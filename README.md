# Flowers for Friends
The player plays as a pink flower, looking for other flowers in each level and creating bouquets in pre-specified target shapes. 

## Instructions:
**Movement & Gameplay:**
1. The player (the pink flower) can move using arrow keys.
2. Pressing z will undo the last move made by the player.
3. Pressing r will restart the current level.

**Navigating Game Elements & Rules:**
1. The player can attach to blue flowers from any side by being directly next to them.
2. The player cannot detach from a blue flower once it has been attached.
3. The player can maneuver and push around orange flowers, but cannot attach to them.
4. Consecutive flowers of the same color will move together.
5. Leaves can cover holes to reach hidden/trapped flowers.
6. Purple flowers can only move left!

## Mechanics:
1. The core mechanic in the game is “attaching” and maneuvering around flowers on each level to create one or more bouquets. 
2. Blue flowers are automatically attached to when the player is directly next to them.
   -  Blue flowers can attach to each other.
   -  Attached blue flowers act as an extension of the player.
3. Orange flowers can be pushed from every direction, but cannot be attached to.
4. Consecutive flowers of the same color will move together if interacted with.
   - The same goes for any consecutive flowers as long as the movement follows the core mechanics for each type of flower.
5. Leaves can be used to cover holes and open up paths to hidden flowers.
   - The player attaches to leaves automatically (the same way they attach to blue flowers).
6. Purple flowers are automatically attached to from any side, but can only move left if attached to the player.
   - If the player has extensions (blue flowers), purple flowers can be maneuvered in any direction.

## Good luck and have fun!
